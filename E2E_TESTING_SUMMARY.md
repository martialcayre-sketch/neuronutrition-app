# E2E Testing Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Firebase Emulator Logs Monitoring

- Deployed updated Firestore rules to production
- Restarted Firebase emulators with updated configuration
- No Firestore rule errors observed during test execution
- Emulators running on:
  - Auth: 127.0.0.1:9098
  - Firestore: 127.0.0.1:8081
  - Functions: 127.0.0.1:5002
  - UI: http://127.0.0.1:4002/

### 2. E2E Redirect Flow Tests

Created comprehensive Playwright tests in `e2e/redirects.spec.ts`:

- ✅ Unverified patient redirects to `/verify-email`
- ✅ Verified but pending patient redirects to `/patient/pending-approval`
- ✅ Approved patient reaches `/patient/home`
- **All 3 tests passing (24.1s runtime)**

### 3. Firebase Functions Upgrade

- Updated `functions/package.json` from firebase-functions ^4.7.0 to ^5.1.0
- Installed version: 5.1.1
- Successfully compiled TypeScript functions
- Emulators load both functions correctly:
  - `onAuthCreate` (us-central1, auth trigger)
  - `approvePatient` (europe-west1, HTTP callable)

## 📝 Known Issues

### Practitioner Approval Flow Test

Created `e2e/practitioner-approvals.spec.ts` but encountered auth state persistence issue:

- ✅ Practitioner login works (verified in `e2e/auth-debug.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Patient creation and Firestore query work
- ❌ Auth state doesn't persist when navigating from `/practitioner/home` to `/practitioner/approvals`
- Issue: After successful login, subsequent navigation triggers redirect back to login page

**Root Cause**: Firebase Auth state in browser context doesn't persist between `page.goto()` calls in Playwright when using emulators. This appears to be a test environment issue rather than application code issue.

**Workaround Options**:

1. Use cookies/localStorage manipulation to persist auth tokens
2. Test the approval flow via direct API calls instead of UI navigation
3. Investigate Playwright's `storageState` feature for auth persistence

### Composite Index Added

Added Firestore composite index for practitioner approvals query:

```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "users",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldPath": "role", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "chosenPractitionerId", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "approvalStatus", "order": "ASCENDING" },
    { "fieldPath": "createdAt", "order": "DESCENDING" }
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Test Coverage

### Passing Tests (4/5)

1. Patient redirect flows (3 tests)
2. Practitioner authentication (1 test)

### Failing Tests (1/5)

1. Practitioner approval workflow (auth persistence issue in test environment)

## 📊 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `package.json` - Added test:e2e scripts

### Modified Files

- `functions/package.json` - Upgraded firebase-functions to ^5.1.0
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Added composite index for approvals query

## 🚀 Run Commands

```powershell
# Start emulators
Set-Location C:\Dev\neuronutrition-app
firebase emulators:start

# Run all e2e tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific test
pnpm test:e2e --grep "redirect"

# Run with UI (headed mode)
pnpm test:e2e:headed

# Install Playwright browsers (one-time)
pnpm test:e2e:install
```

## 🔍 Manual Verification Checklist

Since the practitioner approval e2e test has auth persistence issues in the test environment, manual verification is recommended:

1. ✅ Start emulators: `firebase emulators:start`
2. ✅ Start dev server: `pnpm dev`
3. ✅ Create patient account → verify email sent
4. ✅ Login before email verification → redirects to `/verify-email`
5. ✅ Verify email in emulator UI
6. ✅ Login after verification → redirects to `/patient/pending-approval`
7. ⚠️ Login as practitioner → navigate to `/practitioner/approvals` → see pending patients
8. ⚠️ Approve patient → list updates
9. ⚠️ Login as approved patient → reaches `/patient/home`

## 📌 Recommendations

1. **Auth Persistence**: Investigate Playwright `storageState` for maintaining auth between navigations
2. **API Testing**: Consider adding direct API tests for the `approvePatient` callable function
3. **Java Version**: Upgrade to JDK 21+ (currently on < 21, deprecation warning)
4. **Node Version**: Match functions engines (20) with host version (currently 22)
5. **Firebase Functions**: Consider addressing breaking changes in v5 if any issues arise

## ✨ Success Metrics

- **Firestore Rules**: ✅ Deployed and no errors
- **Patient Redirects**: ✅ 100% passing (3/3 tests)
- **Functions Upgrade**: ✅ Clean build and deployment
- **Emulators**: ✅ All services running
- **Test Infrastructure**: ✅ Playwright configured and working
